# Intro

Flipside's governance team works deeply with the MakerDAO team to
create, discuss, and vote on proposals that ultimately improve Maker's
market position and revenue model. In order to increase our influence at
Maker, we seek delegation of MKR to our voting address.

This markdown details use of the new Flipside `ethscore` package to
identify potential addresses to target to request/earn delegation of
their MKR to our voting address.

# Package Requirements

ethscore uses shroomDK to access Flipside data for its analysis. The
best way to install these packages is via devtools install_github().

```{r, eval = FALSE,  message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
# This chunk does not eval
# library(devtools) # install if you haven't already
# devtools::install_github(repo = 'FlipsideCrypto/sdk', subdir = 'r/shroomDK')
# devtools::install_github(repo = 'FlipsideCrypto/ethscore')
```

# Addressable Market of MKR Delegation

Not all holders of an ERC20 are externally owned accounts (EOAs). Some
are contract addresses, others are gnosis-safes. Among EOAs, there are
central exchange managed EOAs for coordinating deposits and withdrawals
on and off chain which would be inappropriate targets for delegation.
Also some EOAs are 'cold storage' in that they hold a balance but have
never initiated a transaction. If an EOA has never done a transaction,
it is unlikely its first will be delegation of a token which requires
approvals and other contract interactions that the user may find risky.

Thus, for the purposes of growing our delegation, it is imperative we
understand the addressable market as:

 - EOAs that are active and likely human owned
 - Gnosis safes, e.g., DAO multi-sigs.
 - MKR in the delegate contract(s)
  - Note: this is 'pvp' in that each MKR we are delegated from this contract is explicitly a MKR taken from another delegate. While we support competition, our first goal is to activate more MKR, not simply fight over a fixed pool.  

## Current balance of MKR held by those with 1+ MKR

'Dust' is common in crypto. Users make swaps of non-integer sizes and
end up with balances that use many of the 18 decimals permitted by
ERC20s, e.g., having 0.0042069 MKR (\~ \$3 at time of writing). This
naturally inflates the 'holders' number we commonly see in tools like
etherscan.

library(plotly)

mkr <- tolower("0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2")
total_supply <- 977631
total_holders <- 87789

max_block <- 15440000 # August 30th 11AM UTC
api_key <- readLines("api_key.txt") # get a free key @ https://sdk.flipsidecrypto.xyz/shroomdk

mkr_balances <- address_token_balance(token_address = mkr, min_tokens = 1, 
                                      block_max = max_block, api_key = api_key)

plot_ly(mkr_balances, x = ~ADDRESS_TYPE, y = ~log(NEW_VALUE), color = ~ADDRESS_TYPE,
        boxpoints = "all", jitter = 0.3,
        hoverinfo = 'text',
        hovertext = ~paste0(
          'Log-MKR Balance: ',
          round(log(NEW_VALUE), 2),'\n Raw MKR Balance: ', 
          scales::label_comma()(floor(NEW_VALUE))
        ),
        type = 'box') %>% 
  layout(title = '\nDistribution of MKR among those with 1+ MKR',
         xaxis = list(title = 'Address Type'),
         yaxis = list(title = 'LOG(MKR Balance)')
  )

num_active_eoas <- nrow(mkr_balances %>% dplyr::filter(ADDRESS_TYPE == "EOA"))
mkr_held_by_active_eoas <- mkr_balances %>% 
  dplyr::filter(ADDRESS_TYPE == "EOA") %>% 
  summarise(sum(NEW_VALUE)) %>% 
  as.numeric() %>% floor()

```

Of the `r scales::label_comma()(total_holders)` Holders of MKR, only
`r label_comma()(nrow(mkr_balances))` (
`r floor(100*nrow(mkr_balances)/total_holders)`%) have at least 1 whole
MKR (\~\$700 at time of writing).

Given that MKR uses on-chain voting on the Ethereum Layer 1, it may be
cost prohibitive in ETH gas terms for smaller holders to delegate and
vote on-chain (as opposed to an off-chain tool like Snapshot).

Because holdings of most ERC20s is highly skewed (i.e., most addresses
have very few MKR and a few have very large amounts) a LOG scale is used
to more cleanly see differences in the distribution of MKR across
Address Types.

The key insights to note:

 - Non-targets like contracts, cold storage EOAs, and central exchange EOAs have a wide variance in their MKR holdings.
 - The top holders of MKR are contracts and central exchange EOAs.

In practical terms, of the `r label_comma()(total_supply)` MKR total
supply held by `r label_comma()(total_holders)` holders (Etherscan
above), there are only `r label_comma()(num_active_eoas)` EOAs active
and with enough MKR (1+) to be delegate targets. These EOAs hold
`r label_comma()(mkr_held_by_active_eoas)` MKR, only
`r floor(100*mkr_held_by_active_eoas/total_supply)`% of supply.

```{r}
mkr_smmry <- mkr_balances %>% group_by(ADDRESS_TYPE) %>% 
  summarise(num = n(),
            total = scales::label_comma()(floor(sum(NEW_VALUE))),
            avg = scales::label_comma()(floor(mean(NEW_VALUE))), 
            median = scales::label_comma()(floor(median(NEW_VALUE))),
            max = scales::label_comma()(floor(max(NEW_VALUE))),
            sd = scales::label_comma()(floor(sd(NEW_VALUE))))

reactable(mkr_smmry,
columns = list(
  ADDRESS_TYPE = colDef(name = 'Address Type'),
  num = colDef(name = 'Count', align = 'right'),
  total = colDef(name = 'Total', align = 'right'),
  avg = colDef(name = 'Average', align = 'right'),
  median = colDef(name = 'Median', align = 'right'),
  max = colDef(name = 'Max', align = 'right'),
  sd = colDef(name = 'Standard Deviation', align = 'right')
))

```

```{r}

mkr_gov <- floor(mkr_balances[
      mkr_balances$ADDRESS == tolower('0x0a3f6849f78076aefaDf113F5BED87720274dDC0'), "NEW_VALUE"]
    )
mkr_available <- mkr_gov + mkr_held_by_active_eoas
```

The MKR governance contract:
`0x0a3f6849f78076aefadf113f5bed87720274ddc0` held
`r label_comma()(mkr_gov)` MKR as of block `r label_comma()(max_block)`.
The Largest contract and overall address holder of MKR.

This means of the total `r label_comma()(total_supply)` MKR:
`r label_comma()(mkr_available)`(\~
`r floor(100*mkr_available/total_supply)`%) is practically available for
delegation.

 - `r label_comma()(mkr_held_by_active_eoas)` in EOAs w/ 1+ MKR that are not in the governance contract.
 - `r label_comma()(mkr_gov)` in the governance contract whose delegation can be fought over pvp style.
 - Note: excluding the low number of gnosis safes for now.

At time of writing, Flipside Crypto has \~9,000 MKR delegated to it
(4.7% of current governance).

# Time-Weighted MKR Holders

Instead of analyzing holders based on current balance on MKR, we can add
weight for *having held* MKR for a long time. For example, weighing an
address whose held 10 MKR for 100,000 blocks as a better delegate target
than one who has held 100 MKR for only 1,000 blocks.

Giving users 1 point per MKR for every 1,000 blocks where they held at
least 0.1 MKR in the range of Jan 1, 2021 (block #:11,566,000) to Aug
30th 11am UTC (block \# 15,440,000) it is clear there is a strong
correlation between holding MKR now and having held it in the past- but
important outliers and nuance allow for more precision in targeting
potential delegates.

```{r,  message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}

                                                        min_tokens =  0.1,
                                                        block_min = min_block,

# Address Selection

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

select_eoas <- mkr_tw_bal %>% dplyr::filter(ADDRESS_TYPE == "EOA", 
                                            TIME_WEIGHTED_SCORE >= 10000,
                                            NEW_VALUE >= 50) 

plot_ly(select_eoas, x = ~NEW_VALUE, y = ~TIME_WEIGHTED_SCORE, 
        color = ~ADDRESS_TYPE, type = 'scatter',
        hoverinfo = 'text',
        hovertext = ~paste0(
          'RAW-MKR Balance: ',
          scales::label_comma()(floor(NEW_VALUE)),
          '\n Raw MKR TW Score: ',
          scales::label_comma()(floor(TIME_WEIGHTED_SCORE))
        )
) %>% 
  layout(title = '\n Current MKR Balance vs Time-Weighted Score',
         xaxis = list(title = 'Current MKR Balance'),
         yaxis = list(title = 'MKR TW Score')
  )

```

Subsetting to target EOAs (i.e., not central exchange associated nor
cold storage) with at least 50 MKR and a time-weighted score of 10,000
(equivalent of holding 100 MKR for 100,000 blocks) results in
`r nrow(select_eoas)` MKR holders. Unlike previous visuals, the above
visual is *not* LOG adjusted, so the skew in both amount and time held
is very noticeable.

To assess fitness for direct outreach, the number of transactions, days
active, and last transaction date are pulled for the select EOAs.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
query <- {
"
with select_tx AS (
SELECT BLOCK_TIMESTAMP, TX_HASH, FROM_ADDRESS as ADDRESS FROM ethereum.core.fact_transactions
WHERE FROM_ADDRESS IN ('ADDRESSLIST') AND 
BLOCK_NUMBER >= _MIN_BLOCK_ AND 
BLOCK_NUMBER <= _MAX_BLOCK_
)

SELECT ADDRESS, COUNT(*) as num_tx,
count(DISTINCT(date_trunc('DAY', block_timestamp))) as num_days,
MAX(block_timestamp) as last_tx_date FROM
select_tx 
GROUP BY ADDRESS
"
}

alist <- paste0(select_eoas$ADDRESS, collapse = "','")
query <- gsub('ADDRESSLIST', replacement = alist, x = query)
query <- gsub('_MIN_BLOCK_', replacement = min_block, x = query)
query <- gsub('_MAX_BLOCK_', replacement = max_block, x = query)

select_stats <- auto_paginate_query(query, api_key)

eoa_stats <- merge(select_eoas, select_stats, by = 'ADDRESS')
eoa_stats$LAST_TX_DATE <- as.Date(eoa_stats$LAST_TX_DATE)

final_eoa <- eoa_stats %>% dplyr::filter(
  NUM_TX < 100000,
  NUM_DAYS <= 600,
  NUM_DAYS >= 5,
  LAST_TX_DATE > (max(eoa_stats$LAST_TX_DATE) - 180)
)

```

Some noticeable issues are present among this selection:

-   `r sum(eoa_stats$NUM_TX >= 100000)` EOAs with 100,000+ Transactions
    (bots?).
-   `r sum(eoa_stats$NUM_DAYS >= 600)` EOAs active nearly every single
    day in time period (bots?).
-   `r sum(eoa_stats$NUM_DAYS <= 5)` EOAs active less than 5 days in
    time period.
-   `r sum(eoa_stats$LAST_TX_DATE < (max(eoa_stats$LAST_TX_DATE) - 180))`
    EOAs inactive for last 6+ months.

Subsetting to addresses with \< 100,000 tx; \< 600 days active; at least
5 days active; and active within the last 6 months results in
`r nrow(final_eoa)` addresses holding a total of
`r label_comma()(sum(final_eoa$NEW_VALUE))` MKR.

# Address Contact

Address to address communication for direct outreach is still immature.
To identify potential willingness to be contacted and pitched
delegation, two outreach avenues are identified:

 - The Ethereum Name Service of each address (if available) is pulled to see if any addresses willingly doxx their 
    social media (e.g., by having their ENS in their Twitter name).
 - Governance activity in other DAOs (i.e., Snapshot votes) for potential reach out via DAO partnerships.

## ENS

Using ENS NFT address `0x57f1887a8bf19b14fc0df6fd9b2acc9af147ea85` a one
to many test of NFT ownership is identified.

## Snapshot 

To improve identification of addresses, snapshot voting history is assessed to identify 
potential DAO partnerships for boosting delegation.
